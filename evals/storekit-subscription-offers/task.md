A subscription app wants to target cancelled subscribers with win-back and promotional offers. The current plan calls `Product.SubscriptionInfo.Status.status(for:)`, shows every `product.subscription?.winBackOffers` entry, uses `.subscriptionPromotionalOffer(offer: signature:)` on a StoreKit SwiftUI view, and logs applied offers with `transaction.offerType` and `transaction.offerID`.

Correct the plan using current StoreKit APIs and explain how to test the offer paths.
