# DockKit

Framework for integrating with motorized camera stands and gimbals that
physically track subjects by rotating the iPhone. DockKit handles motor
control, subject detection, and framing so camera apps get 360-degree pan
and 90-degree tilt tracking with no additional code. Apps can override
system tracking to supply custom observations, control motors directly,
or adjust framing. iOS 17+, Swift 6.2.

## Setup

Import DockKit:

```swift
import DockKit
```

DockKit requires a physical DockKit-compatible accessory and a real device.
The Simulator cannot connect to dock hardware.

No special entitlements or Info.plist keys are required. The framework
communicates with paired accessories automatically through the DockKit
system daemon.

The app must use AVFoundation camera APIs. DockKit hooks into the camera
pipeline to analyze frames for system tracking.

## Discovering Accessories

Use `DockAccessoryManager.shared` to observe dock connections:

```swift
import DockKit

func observeAccessories() async throws {
    for await stateChange in try DockAccessoryManager.shared.accessoryStateChanges {
        switch stateChange.state {
        case .docked:
            guard let accessory = stateChange.accessory else { continue }
            // Accessory is connected and ready
            configureAccessory(accessory)
        case .undocked:
            // iPhone removed from dock
            handleUndocked()
        @unknown default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

`accessoryStateChanges` is an `AsyncSequence` that emits
`DockAccessory.StateChange` values. Each change includes:

- `state` -- `.docked` or `.undocked`
- `accessory` -- the `DockAccessory` instance (present when docked)
- `trackingButtonEnabled` -- whether the physical tracking button is active

### Accessory Identity

Each `DockAccessory` has an `identifier` with:

- `name` -- human-readable accessory name
- `category` -- `.trackingStand` (currently the only category)
- `uuid` -- unique identifier for this accessory

Hardware details are available via `firmwareVersion` and `hardwareModel`.

## System Tracking

System tracking is DockKit's default mode. When enabled, the system
analyzes camera frames through built-in ML inference, detects faces and
bodies, and drives the motors to keep subjects in frame. Any app using
AVFoundation camera APIs benefits automatically.

### Enable or Disable

```swift
// Enable system tracking (default)
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(true)

// Disable system tracking for custom control
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)
```

Check current state:

```swift
let isEnabled = DockAccessoryManager.shared.isSystemTrackingEnabled
```

System tracking state does not persist across app termination, reboots,
or background/foreground transitions. Set it explicitly whenever the app
needs a specific value.

### Tap to Select Subject

Allow users to select a specific subject by tapping:

```swift
// Select the subject at a screen coordinate
try await accessory.selectSubject(at: CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5))

// Select specific subjects by identifier
try await accessory.selectSubjects([subjectUUID])

// Clear selection (return to automatic selection)
try await accessory.selectSubjects([])
```

## Custom Tracking

Disable system tracking and provide your own observations when using
custom ML models or the Vision framework.

### Providing Observations

Construct `DockAccessory.Observation` values from your inference output
and pass them to the accessory at 10-30 fps:

```swift
import DockKit
import AVFoundation

func processFrame(
    _ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer,
    accessory: DockAccessory,
    device: AVCaptureDevice
) async throws {
    let cameraInfo = DockAccessory.CameraInformation(
        captureDevice: device.deviceType,
        cameraPosition: device.position,
        orientation: .corrected,
        cameraIntrinsics: nil,
        referenceDimensions: nil
    )

    // Create observation from your detection output
    let observation = DockAccessory.Observation(
        identifier: 0,
        type: .humanFace,
        rect: detectedFaceRect,       // CGRect in normalized coordinates
        faceYawAngle: nil
    )

    try await accessory.track(
        [observation],
        cameraInformation: cameraInfo
    )
}
```

### Observation Types

| Type | Use |
|---|---|
| `.humanFace` | Preserves system multi-person tracking and framing optimizations |
| `.humanBody` | Full body tracking |
| `.object` | Arbitrary objects (pets, hands, barcodes, etc.) |

The `rect` uses normalized coordinates with a lower-left origin (same
coordinate system as Vision framework -- no conversion needed).

### Camera Information

`DockAccessory.CameraInformation` describes the active camera. Set
orientation to `.corrected` when coordinates are already relative to the
bottom-left corner of the screen. Optional `cameraIntrinsics` and
`referenceDimensions` improve tracking accuracy.

Track variants also accept `[AVMetadataObject]` instead of observations,
and an optional `CVPixelBuffer` for enhanced tracking.

## Framing and Region of Interest

### Framing Modes

Control how the system frames tracked subjects:

```swift
try await accessory.setFramingMode(.center)
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `.automatic` | System decides optimal framing |
| `.center` | Keep subject centered (default) |
| `.left` | Frame subject in left third |
| `.right` | Frame subject in right third |

Read the current mode:

```swift
let currentMode = accessory.framingMode
```

Use `.left` or `.right` when graphic overlays occupy part of the frame.

### Region of Interest

Constrain tracking to a specific area of the video frame:

```swift
// Normalized coordinates, origin at upper-left
let squareRegion = CGRect(x: 0.25, y: 0.0, width: 0.5, height: 1.0)
try await accessory.setRegionOfInterest(squareRegion)
```

Read the current region:

```swift
let currentROI = accessory.regionOfInterest
```

Use region of interest when cropping to a non-standard aspect ratio
(e.g., square video for conferencing) so subjects stay within the
visible area.

## Motor Control

Disable system tracking before controlling motors directly.

### Angular Velocity

Set continuous rotation speed in radians per second:

```swift
import Spatial

// Pan right at 0.2 rad/s, tilt down at 0.1 rad/s
let velocity = Vector3D(x: 0.1, y: 0.2, z: 0.0)
try await accessory.setAngularVelocity(velocity)

// Stop all motion
try await accessory.setAngularVelocity(Vector3D())
```

Axes:
- `x` -- pitch (tilt). Positive tilts down on iOS.
- `y` -- yaw (pan). Positive pans right.
- `z` -- roll (if supported by hardware).

### Set Orientation

Move to a specific position over a duration:

```swift
let target = Vector3D(x: 0.0, y: 0.5, z: 0.0)  // Yaw 0.5 rad
let progress = try accessory.setOrientation(
    target,
    duration: .seconds(2),
    relative: false
)
```

Also accepts `Rotation3D` for quaternion-based orientation. Set
`relative: true` to move relative to the current position. The returned
`Progress` object tracks completion.

### Motion State

Monitor the accessory's current position and velocity:

```swift
for await state in accessory.motionStates {
    let positions = state.angularPositions   // Vector3D
    let velocities = state.angularVelocities // Vector3D
    let time = state.timestamp
    if let error = state.error {
        // Motor error occurred
    }
}
```

### Setting Limits

Restrict range of motion and maximum speed per axis:

```swift
let yawLimit = try DockAccessory.Limits.Limit(
    positionRange: -1.0 ..< 1.0,   // radians
    maximumSpeed: 0.5               // rad/s
)
let limits = DockAccessory.Limits(yaw: yawLimit, pitch: nil, roll: nil)
try accessory.setLimits(limits)
```

## Animations

Built-in character animations that move the dock expressively:

```swift
// Disable system tracking before animating
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)

let progress = try await accessory.animate(motion: .kapow)

// Wait for completion
while !progress.isFinished && !progress.isCancelled {
    try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(100))
}

// Restore system tracking
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(true)
```

| Animation | Effect |
|---|---|
| `.yes` | Nodding motion |
| `.no` | Shaking motion |
| `.wakeup` | Startup-style motion |
| `.kapow` | Dramatic pendulum swing |

Animations start from the accessory's current position and execute
asynchronously. Always restore tracking state after completion.

## Tracking State and Subject Selection

iOS 18+ exposes ML-derived tracking signals through `trackingStates`.
Each `TrackingState` contains a timestamp and a list of
`TrackedSubjectType` values (`.person` or `.object`). Persons include
`speakingConfidence`, `lookingAtCameraConfidence`, and `saliencyRank`
(1 = most important, lower is more salient).

```swift
for await state in accessory.trackingStates {
    for subject in state.trackedSubjects {
        switch subject {
        case .person(let person):
            let speaking = person.speakingConfidence   // 0.0 - 1.0
            let saliency = person.saliencyRank
        case .object(let object):
            let saliency = object.saliencyRank
        }
    }
}
```

Use `selectSubjects(_:)` to lock tracking onto specific subjects by UUID.
Pass an empty array to return to automatic selection. See
`references/dockkit-patterns.md` for speaker-tracking and saliency
filtering recipes.

## Accessory Events

Physical buttons on the dock trigger events:

```swift
for await event in accessory.accessoryEvents {
    switch event {
    case .cameraShutter:
        // Start or stop recording / take photo
        break
    case .cameraFlip:
        // Switch front/back camera
        break
    case .cameraZoom(factor: let factor):
        // factor > 0 means zoom in, < 0 means zoom out
        break
    case .button(id: let id, pressed: let pressed):
        // Custom button with identifier
        break
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}
```

For first-party apps (Camera, FaceTime), shutter/flip/zoom events work
automatically. Third-party apps receive these events and implement
behavior through AVFoundation.

## Battery Monitoring

Monitor the dock's battery status (iOS 18+). A dock can report multiple
batteries, each identified by `name`:

```swift
for await battery in accessory.batteryStates {
    let level = battery.batteryLevel       // 0.0 - 1.0
    let charging = battery.chargeState     // .charging, .notCharging, .notChargeable
    let low = battery.lowBattery
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### DON'T: Control motors without disabling system tracking

```swift
// WRONG -- system tracking fights manual commands
try await accessory.setAngularVelocity(velocity)

// CORRECT -- disable system tracking first
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)
try await accessory.setAngularVelocity(velocity)
```

### DON'T: Assume tracking state persists across lifecycle events

```swift
// WRONG -- state may have reset after backgrounding
func applicationDidBecomeActive() {
    // Assume custom tracking is still active
}

// CORRECT -- re-set tracking state on foreground
func applicationDidBecomeActive() {
    Task {
        try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)
    }
}
```

### DON'T: Call track() outside the recommended rate

```swift
// WRONG -- calling once per second is too slow
try await accessory.track(observations, cameraInformation: cameraInfo)
// (called at 1 fps)

// CORRECT -- call at 10-30 fps
// Hook into AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate for per-frame calls
```

### DON'T: Forget to restore tracking after animations

```swift
// WRONG -- tracking stays disabled after animation
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)
let progress = try await accessory.animate(motion: .kapow)

// CORRECT -- restore tracking when animation completes
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)
let progress = try await accessory.animate(motion: .kapow)
while !progress.isFinished && !progress.isCancelled {
    try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(100))
}
try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(true)
```

### DON'T: Use DockKit in Simulator

DockKit requires a physical DockKit-compatible accessory. Guard
initialization and provide fallback behavior when no accessory is
available.
